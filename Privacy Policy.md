Overview
DoMinder is a local-first reminders app. Your reminders and settings are stored on your device using AsyncStorage. We do not operate a server and do not collect, sell, or share personal data.
Data We Store
- Reminders you create (title, schedule, repeat rules, local flags)
- App settings (theme, notification preferences, sort order)
This data never leaves your device unless you back it up via your OS.
Permissions
Notifications are used to alert you at scheduled times. Sounds and vibration are used according to your preferences. Camera, location, contacts, or other sensitive permissions are not used.
Third-Party Services
The app does not integrate analytics SDKs or advertising networks. On some platforms, system services (e.g., OS notifications) may process data per their policies.
Data Control
You can delete reminders individually or clear app data from your device settings to remove all stored information.
